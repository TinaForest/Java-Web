# JavaWeb Start

## BookNest
This is my first JavaWeb application where users can log in, register, and purchase books.

I developed this project while following a series of [JavaWeb tutorials](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Y7411K7zz) on Bilibili, instructed by Shangguigu. The courses provide not only a solid foundation in JavaWeb but also hands-on project content. The lessons (parts 1-120) focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, and jQuery, and I also learned about web servers or servlet containers like Tomcat.

I really enjoyed learning from the instructor, Zhenguo. Heâ€™s both funny and patient, making the lessons engaging and lively. Having been abroad for over a year, I often miss my parents and my home country. Hearing the familiar laughs and the jokes he made during class brought me back to my high school days, making me feel at home again.
